# Useful Plugins

Here are some [remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) that might be useful.

## remark-toc

https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc

- Adds inline table of contents to pages.

Note: This plugin searches for a heading in the page to generate the table of contents.
`typedoc-plugin-remark` inserts this heading automatically (currently to Module, Interface, Class and Enum pages).

```sh npm2yarn
npm install remark-toc --save-dev
```

```json filename="typedoc.json"
{
  "remarkPlugins": ["remark-toc"]
}
```

## remark-github

https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-github

- Links references to commits, issues, and users in the same way that GitHub does in comments.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install remark-github --save-dev
```

```json filename="typedoc.json"
{
  "remarkPlugins": ["remark-github"]
}
```
