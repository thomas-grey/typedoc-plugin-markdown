## 4.0.0 (2024-05-03)

> v4 is a major release that includes a number of bug fixes, new features and UI improvements.

### Architectural Changes

- Handlebars as a dependency has been removed.
- Updated customization model with the ability to set hooks, events and custom theming.
- Exposed navigation structure.

### Features

- Updated output file structure.
- Improved and cleaner UI.
- A set of updated and additional new options with comprehensive documentation.
- Exported option types and JSON schema.

### Structural Changes

- Each module member is now output to its own file by default. See option `--outputFileStrategy`. To achieve the same output as v3 (whereby only Classes, Enums and Interfaces have their own file), set the option `membersWithOwnFile` option.
- Parameters are output as a list by default. To achieve the same output as v3 (where parameters are output as a table), use option `--parametersFormat=table`.

### Breaking Changes

- Because the file structure has changed you may need to update any cross references to files in your documentation.
- Setting `theme` to `"markdown"` is no longer required and should be removed.
- The option `indexTitle` has been removed. Please use the `"title.indexPage"` key with option `--textContentMappings`.
- The option `allReflectionsHaveOwnDocument` has been removed (this behaviour is now the default). Please see option `outputFileStrategy`](/docs/options#outputfilestrategy).
- The option `entryDocument` has been renamed to `entryFileName` to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `namedAnchors` has been renamed to `useHTMLAnchors` to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `hideInPageTOC` has been removed. In-page TOC are no longer included by default. You can include in-page TOCs by using `typedoc-plugin-remark` and the `remark-toc` plugin.
- The option `objectLiteralTypeDeclarationStyle` has been removed. Please use option `--typeDeclarationFormat=list`.
